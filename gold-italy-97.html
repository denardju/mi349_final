    <h2>Pictures of Gold Italy insipred Nike Air Max 97 have surfaced.</h2>
    <p>Italy has always been devoted to Nike's Air Max 97 silhouette. Pre the shoe's 20th anniversary the Air Max 97 saw little love 
    from sneaker wearers, especially compared to its other 90's counterparts. However, Italy has always shown love for the Air Max 97. 
    The Silver Bullet 97 was a popular shoe in Europe as it drew from many design principles based in Milan. 
    Images of a gold Air Max 97 have surfaced, with many thinking that it may be a gold alterative of the silver bullet. 
    There is no name for this shoe as of yet. Nike has not given a released date for the model either, but it is believed to 
    be released before the end of 2022.
